I'm excited to share details about my first game project: **Team Strike**.

This is a 2D multiplayer game inspired by classics like Contra. Players can join matches either over a local network (LAN) or via the internet, making it easy for friends to team up or compete against each other. The game supports both cooperative and competitive modes, allowing players to play as allies or as opponents.

### Key Features

- **Multiplayer Support:** Play with friends on LAN or online.
- **Team or Solo Play:** Choose to collaborate or compete.
- **Collectibles:** Find items that provide healing, ammo refills, and a variety of weapons.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** The game ends when the timer runs out, and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.
- **Teleportation Portal:** A unique portal mechanic lets players instantly move from one part of the map to another, adding a strategic twist to the gameplay.

This project was a great learning experience, helping me understand the fundamentals of multiplayer networking, game mechanics, and level design. I'm looking forward to building even more exciting games in the future!
