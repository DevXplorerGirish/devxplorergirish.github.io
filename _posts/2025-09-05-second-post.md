I'm excited to share details about my second game project: **Ultimate Jungle Survival 3D**.

**Ultimate Jungle Survival 3D** is a survival game built in Unity, where the player must gather resources, craft items, and fight against wild animals to survive. The game features a dynamic day/night cycle, resource management, and AI-driven animal encounters.

### Key Features

- **Exploration & Resource Gathering** – Collect materials and resources to survive in the wilderness.
- **Crafting System** – Build tools, weapons, and survival items to progress in gameplay.
- **Animal AI** – Implemented state machines for patrol, chase, and attack behaviors using C#.
- **Day/Night Cycle** – Dynamic lighting affects visibility and gameplay difficulty.
- **Survival Mechanics** – Player health, stamina, and environmental interactions create a realistic survival experience.

This project was also great learning experience, helping me understand the fundamentals of Game Mechanics, Enemy AI and Level Design. I'm looking forward to building even more exciting games in the future!
