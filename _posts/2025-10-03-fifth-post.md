**Operation Extraction** is a gameplay prototype developed in Unreal Engine, focused on building and validating core player mechanics and advanced enemy AI systems. The prototype is designed as a combat sandbox to test player control, animation systems, weapon handling, and intelligent enemy behavior, rather than a complete or story-driven game experience.
The primary goal of this prototype is to establish solid core gameplay systems and AI-driven combat interactions. It provides a controlled environment where player mechanics and enemy responses can be iterated and refined.


### Key Features

- **Enemy AI Behaviors** – Patrolling, chasing, attacking, and reacting to the player.
- **Dynamic Combat** – Player can switch between melee and ranged combat depending on the situation.
- **Perception System** – Vision and detection when the AI notices the player.
- **Audio Awareness** – Enemies can listen for player actions, reacting to sounds like footsteps or gunfire.
- **Cover Tactics** – AI can decide when to hide and ambush the player from cover.
<!-- - **Hybrid Workflow** – Core logic in C++, with Blueprints for animation and behavior tuning. -->
- **Gameplay Focused on AI** – Designed specifically to demonstrate responsive and adaptive enemy AI.
<!-- - **Optimized Performance** – C++ implementation ensures scalability for more complex AI. -->

### Future Scope

This prototype is designed as a foundation for further expansion. A time-based rescue mission is planned for a future iteration, where these systems will be extended into structured objectives and mission flow.


Working on Operation Extraction as a prototype helped me deepen my understanding of Unreal Engine gameplay systems, particularly AI Behavior Trees, Blackboards, EQS, animation-driven locomotion, and combat mechanics. The project demonstrates my ability to prototype core systems, iterate on gameplay features, and build AI-focused combat scenarios in Unreal Engine.
