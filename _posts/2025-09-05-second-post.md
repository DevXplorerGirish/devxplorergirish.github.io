**Ultimate Jungle Survival** 3D is a survival game built in Unity, where the player must gather resources, craft items, and fight against wild animals to survive. The game features a dynamic day/night cycle, resource management, and AI-driven animal encounters that evolve based on player actions.


### Key Features

- **Exploration & Resource Gathering** – Collect materials and resources to survive in the wilderness.
- **Crafting System** – Build tools, weapons, and survival items to progress through gameplay.
- **Animal AI** – Implemented state-machine-based behaviors for patrol, chase, and attack sequences.
- **Day/Night Cycle** – Dynamic lighting affects visibility, difficulty, and player strategy.
- **Survival Mechanics** – Player health, stamina, and environmental interactions simulate realistic survival challenges.
- **Inventory & Item Management** – Developed a modular inventory system for collecting, storing, and using crafted or gathered items.
- **Environmental Interaction** – Designed destructible trees, rocks, and collectibles to encourage exploration and resource use.
- **Dynamic Difficulty Scaling** – Adjusted animal aggression and spawn rates based on player progress to maintain balance.

This project was also great learning experience, helping me understand the fundamentals of Game Mechanics, Enemy AI and Level Design. I'm looking forward to building even more exciting games in the future!
