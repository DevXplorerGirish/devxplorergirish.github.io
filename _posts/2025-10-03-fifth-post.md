**Operation Extraction** is a high-intensity rescue mission game built in Unreal Engine, where players must infiltrate enemy territory and rescue a hostage within a strict time limit. The game emphasizes tactical combat, intelligent AI systems, and time-based mission challenges that test both precision and strategy.
The enemy soldiers are powered by Behavior Trees and Blackboard Systems, enabling them to patrol, investigate, take cover, and coordinate attacks dynamically. Players engage in realistic gunfights where every second counts, balancing stealth and aggression to complete objectives under pressure.


### Key Features

- **Enemy AI Behaviors** – Patrolling, chasing, attacking, and reacting to the player.
- **Dynamic Combat** – Enemies switch between melee and ranged combat depending on the situation.
- **Perception System** – Vision and detection when the AI notices the player.
- **Audio Awareness** – Enemies can listen for player actions, reacting to sounds like footsteps or gunfire.
- **Cover Tactics** – AI can decide when to hide and ambush the player from cover.
- **Hybrid Workflow** – Core logic in C++, with Blueprints for animation and behavior tuning.
- **Gameplay Focused on AI** – Designed specifically to demonstrate responsive and adaptive enemy AI.
- **Optimized Performance** – C++ implementation ensures scalability for more complex AI.

Working on Operation Extraction was an incredible experience that deepened my understanding of AI systems in Unreal Engine, especially Behavior Trees and Blackboards. I learned how to design tactical combat scenarios and structure mission objectives under time pressure. This project helped me strengthen my skills in AI-driven gameplay design, C++ scripting, and mission-based level flow.
