**Jungle Sprint** is a 3D endless runner developed in Unreal Engine, where the player is chased by a lion through a dense jungle. The player must dodge obstacles by moving left, right, or jumping while the chase intensifies. The game gradually increases difficulty as the player’s speed increments over time, creating a challenging survival experience.


### Key Features

- **Chase Mechanic** – Player is continuously pursued by a lion, creating tension and urgency.
Endless Runner Controls – Move left, right, and jump to avoid jungle obstacles.
- **Dynamic Difficulty** – Player speed increases over time, making survival progressively harder.
- **Obstacle System** – Integrated traps and hurdles that test reflexes and timing.
- **Loops** – Loop logic is used to manage obstacle spawning, speed increments, and other game logic efficiently.
- **Replayable Gameplay** – Endless structure ensures no two runs feel exactly the same.
- **Collectibles & Power-ups** – Players can gather items like coins, boosts, or temporary shields to aid survival.
- **Visual & Audio Feedback** – Dynamic camera angles, jungle ambient sounds, and lion roar effects enhance immersion and tension.

Creating Jungle Sprint allowed me to explore fast-paced gameplay design and procedural challenge systems in Unreal Engine. I learned how to design smooth, responsive player movement and create a visually appealing environmental flow. This project strengthened my understanding of endless runner mechanics, camera systems, and performance optimization for fluid gameplay.
