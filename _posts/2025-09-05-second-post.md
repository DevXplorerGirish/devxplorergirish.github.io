**Survive the Wild** is a 3D survival experience built in Unity that immerses players in the harsh wilderness, testing their endurance, creativity, and strategic decision-making. Players must explore, gather resources, craft tools, and battle hunger and wildlife threats to stay alive.
The game includes a comprehensive Inventory and Crafting System, allowing players to collect items and combine them into useful tools or weapons. The dynamic wildlife AI system ensures animals behave naturally — some attack on sight, others flee or hunt in packs. Every decision impacts the player’s survival chances, promoting risk-versus-reward gameplay


### Key Features

- **Exploration & Resource Gathering** – Collect materials and resources to survive in the wilderness.
- **Crafting System** – Build tools, weapons, and survival items to progress through gameplay.
- **Animal AI** – Implemented state-machine-based behaviors for patrol, chase, and attack sequences.
- **Day/Night Cycle** – Dynamic lighting affects visibility, difficulty, and player strategy.
- **Survival Mechanics** – Player health, stamina, and environmental interactions simulate realistic survival challenges.
- **Inventory & Item Management** – Developed a modular inventory system for collecting, storing, and using crafted or gathered items.
- **Environmental Interaction** – Designed destructible trees, rocks, and collectibles to encourage exploration and resource use.
- **Dynamic Difficulty Scaling** – Adjusted animal aggression and spawn rates based on player progress to maintain balance.

Survive the Wild taught me how to create system-driven gameplay centered around resource management, crafting, and survival mechanics. I gained valuable experience building a modular inventory system, implementing dynamic wildlife AI, and optimizing player interaction systems. It enhanced my understanding of game balance, player feedback loops, and how small design choices affect player immersion.
