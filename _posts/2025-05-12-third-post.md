**Jungle Escape** is a 3D endless runner developed in Unreal Engine, where the player is chased by a lion through a dense jungle. The player must dodge obstacles by moving left, right, or jumping while the chase intensifies. The game gradually increases difficulty as the player’s speed increments over time, creating a challenging survival experience.



I'm excited to share details about my third game project: **Jungle Escape**.

**Jungle Escape** is a 3D endless runner developed in Unreal Engine, where the player is chased by a lion through a dense jungle. The player must dodge obstacles by moving left, right, or jumping while the chase intensifies. The game gradually increases difficulty as the player’s speed increments over time, creating a challenging survival experience.

### Key Features

- **Chase Mechanic** – Player is continuously pursued by a lion, creating tension and urgency.
Endless Runner Controls – Move left, right, and jump to avoid jungle obstacles.
- **Dynamic Difficulty** – Player speed increases over time, making survival progressively harder.
- **Obstacle System** – Integrated traps and hurdles that test reflexes and timing.
- **Loops** – Loop logic is used to manage obstacle spawning, speed increments, and other game logic efficiently.
- **Replayable Gameplay** – Endless structure ensures no two runs feel exactly the same.
- **Collectibles & Power-ups** – Players can gather items like coins, boosts, or temporary shields to aid survival.
- **Visual & Audio Feedback** – Dynamic camera angles, jungle ambient sounds, and lion roar effects enhance immersion and tension.

This project was also great learning experience, helping me understand the fundamentals of Unreal Engine, Core Game Mechanics, Using Loops and Level Design. I'm looking forward to building even more exciting games in the future!
