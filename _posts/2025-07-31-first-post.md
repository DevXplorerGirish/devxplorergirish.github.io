**Bullet Blitz** is a fast-paced 2D shooter built in Unity, featuring smooth character movement, shooting mechanics, and AI-controlled enemies. The game includes respawn, weapon pickup systems, and a dynamic combat flow designed to keep players engaged. Future plans include adding multiplayer functionality for an even more exciting and replayable experience.


### Key Features

- **Responsive Player Controls** – Implemented precise 2D movement, aiming, and shooting mechanics.
- **AI-Controlled Bots** – Designed enemy AI capable of ranged and melee combat to challenge players.
- **Respawn & Invincibility Systems** – Balanced gameplay with respawn delays and temporary invulnerability.
- **Random Weapon Pickup System** – Added dynamic gun selection for variety in combat encounters.
- **Kill Feed System** – Displays real-time match updates for player and AI eliminations.
- **Replayable Combat Loop** – Combined bots, weapons, and respawn mechanics for engaging matches.
- **Future Multiplayer Support** – Planned addition of online multiplayer for competitive gameplay.
- **Combat Balancing & Tuning** – Adjusted weapon damage, fire rates, and AI difficulty to create fair, skill-based encounters.
- **Wave & Spawn Management** – Developed a system to control enemy spawn timing and difficulty scaling during matches.
- **Optimized Object Pooling** – Implemented pooling for bullets and effects to enhance performance and reduce frame drops.

This project was a great learning experience, helping me understand the fundamentals of Game Mechanics, Enemy AI and Level Design. I'm looking forward to building even more exciting games in the future!
