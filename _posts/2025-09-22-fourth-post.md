**Flamebound** is a 2D action platformer developed in Unreal Engine. The player shoots fireballs at enemies while avoiding traps such as spikes, swinging hammers, and rotating blades. Enemies patrol the level, chase the player when detected, and perform close-range attacks. Health crates provide recovery opportunities, allowing players to survive longer and progress through increasingly difficult stages.


### Key Features

- **Responsive Player Controls** – Smooth 2D movement and fireball-shooting combat system.
- **Enemy AI** – Enemies patrol, detect, chase, and attack the player when close.
- **Hazard Systems** – Designed and implemented deadly traps including spikes, swinging hammers, and rotating blades.
- **Health Pickups** – Health crates restore player health and extend survival during difficult levels.
- **Challenging Gameplay Loop** – Balanced traps, enemy encounters, and combat to keep gameplay engaging.
- **Level Design & Progression** – Created multiple levels with increasing difficulty and environmental variety to enhance replayability.
- **UI & Feedback Systems** – Designed HUD elements like health display and damage indicators to improve player awareness.
- **Performance Optimization** – Reduced redundant event calls and optimized collision checks for smoother frame rates.

This project was also great learning experience, helping me understand the fundamentals of Unreal Engine, Core Game Mechanics, Using Loops and Level Design. I'm looking forward to building even more exciting games in the future!
